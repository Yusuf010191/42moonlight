##Learning JavaScript, the “right” way.
#Day 02: Small Beginnings
I’m currently still going strong on the Javascript30 challenges, and I grow increasingly more pleased with the projects in it. They seem to focus on some really cool aspects of JavaScript, most notably the first exercise which covers the amazing tool, querySelector (which I didn’t use enough before).
Currently, I’m first completing the exercises, then looking at Wes Bos’s (maker of the JavaScript30 course) code to see if he did something better. I’m trying to push the boundaries of the exercises by decreasing the line count of my code as much as possible (reasonably). However, being day 3 of the course there are not much to the exercises.
I plan on reading Eloquent JavaScript and doing the exercises from it on the plane when I go home for the holidays. Around this time is when my growth/progress will really ramp up and I’ll have more to write about.
A friend of mine linked me this and I found it pretty inspiring. I plan to do something similar for JavaScript, maybe not the same scale.
For now, this is it.
NOTE: I will try to make this a daily thing but right now there isn’t much to talk about daily.
