# Learning JavaScript, the “right” way.
## Day 01: Introduction
Today is my birthday, and therefore a new year for me. My new years resolution is to “relearn” JavaScript, the “right” way. This may not necessarily be the actual right way to learn, but it’ll be a whole lot better than what I did before.

I’m rereading Eloquent JavaScript, The Good Parts, the whole kit and caboodle. And doing any and all JavaScript challenges and courses (mostly free at the moment) I can get my hands on.
Why am I doing this? Ah! Valid question!

Because at the moment, I’ve developed many bad habits while writing in JavaScript, and I feel that many of these bad habits were from learning incorrectly.
To get started I’m doing this course: javascript30.com/, and alongside that I’m doing Free Code Camp: freecodecamp.com/.

Free Code Camp is a great resource and I suggest EVERYONE tries it out.
I’ve heard many good things about JavaScript 30 and I’m excited to see what I learn from it.
Medium will act as my blog that I use to keep track of my progress publicly, and maybe help some people who are also learning (or relearning) JavaScript.
