##Learning JavaScript, the “right” way.

#What is this?
This will be documentation for my journey in (re)learning JavaScript. I'll be writing about my experience, thing I've used, and things I made using the wonderful language of JavaScript.

#Why relearn JavaScript?
JavaScript is an amazing language when used to it's strengths. The first run through I had with the language was very flawed and led to me developing bad habits/not using the language to it's flavor. I'm relearning to get a better understanding of the language, to build better habits, and be confident in writing JavaScript code.

#Goal for the project
I'm relearning to get a better understan
ding of the language, to build better habits, and be confident in writing JavaSc
ript code. After confidently learning JavaScript I will also be compiling all my resources used and projects made into a lesson plan for others to follow to learn the language.
