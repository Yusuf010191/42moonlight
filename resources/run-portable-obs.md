##Running OBS on macOS from an External Drive
- **Step one:** Download OBS from [here](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/releases/download/0.15.1/obs-0.15.1-installer.dmg)
- **Step two:** Move the .dmg file to the root of your external drive
- **Step three:** Run the .dmg to install
*(You must perform this step using a machine you have administrative rights on)*
- **Step four:** The OBS executable is located inside the freshly made Applications directory, run it
- **Step five:** Learn how to use OBS

If you already know how to use OBS I would recommend changing your recording directory to point to an 
existing directory on your drive like so, `/Volumes/[DRIVE NAME HERE]/Videos/OBS-Recordings/`
